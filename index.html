         <p>I am a passionate, aspiring Software Engineer  and long-time admirer of the tech industry. I would describe myself as somebody who is dedicated to learning and self-improvement and the fact that I grasp new concepts easily works in my advantage. I always make sure to ask questions and seek clarity to minimise errors and time wastage. I have a growth mindset with is beneficial because I am always ready to embrace change and grow my skill set.</p>
         <br>
         <p>During my Software Engineering bootcamp with HyperionDev, I gained coding experience under the direction of a team of mentors and at times, assistance from my peers. The programming language I have been learning is Python, and I am looking to eventually learn other languages. I have also gained a bit of experience in web development, Object-Oriented Programming, agile development, etc.</p>
         <br>
         <p>I have a passion for identifying problems and coming up with solutions. Being faced with a challenge and coming out on top while also working with a team. I am a big fan of collaboration , having the opportunity o learn from others while also being a contributing factor to the team's success. I am motivated by being a part of a greater cause. The world is becoming more technological and playing a part in that is one of my biggest aspirations. Providing convenience through technology.</p>
         <br>
         <p>I have no work experience in the technical industry, but I am willing to learn. Previously, I worked in the banking industry providing financial services to the clients. I am skilled in Microsoft Office, I have quality communication skills and am a great team player. I am good at problem-solving, as I already mentioned and can be creative which I think is necessary in software engineering when you need to create innovative new systems and functionality, for example. I will soon complete my Software Engineering Bootcamp which will provide me with a MICT SETA certificate.</p>
         <br>
         <p>I have worked on a few projects. I created a program that can be used by a bookstore to keep record of their books. Adding, removing and updating book details. I also created another program for a small business that can help them manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. They can view and update any of their tasks. I have linked my GitHub for easy access.</p>
